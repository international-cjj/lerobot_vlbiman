# TRLC-DK1-Follower URDF

![Visual 3D Model of TRLC-DK1-Follower](https://github.com/andreaskoepf/trlc-dk1-follower-urdf/raw/main/assets/dk1_vsual_right.png)

This repository contains the URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) model of the **DK-1 Follower arm** developed by [The Robot Learning Company (TRLC)](https://www.robot-learning.co/), a German robotics startup based in Munich.

## About the TRLC DK-1

The TRLC DK-1 is an open-source robotic arm designed for robot learning and AI research. It uses a leader-follower configuration where this URDF represents the **follower arm** - the actuated arm that replicates movements from a passive leader arm during teleoperation and data collection for imitation learning.

### URDF Features

- Kinematic chain with joint limits and inertial properties
- Separate visual (GLB) and collision (STL) meshes
- Parallel gripper with left/right finger joints
- Tool center point (TCP) frame at `tool0`
- Wrist camera mount with 15° downward tilt
- SRDF file with joint groups, named poses (home, open, close), and self-collision exclusions
- Simplified collision sphere model (`collision_trlc-dk1.yml`) for use with simulation frameworks like [RoboTwin 2.0](https://robotwin-platform.github.io/)

### Development Tools

This URDF model was created using:

- [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/) - Parametric 3D CAD modeling and URDF export
- [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) - Mesh optimization and GLB export
- [Online URDF Viewer](https://viewer.robotsfan.com/) - Web-based URDF visualization and validation
